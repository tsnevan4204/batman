    "question": "Will Russia use a nuclear weapon by June 30?",
    "description": "A prediction market on whether Russia will use nuclear weapons has been requested many times recently by esteemed academics and thought leaders from across the world, and it is strongly within the public's interest to have accurate price discovery and realtime forecasts on such a topic. Existing prediction markets on this subject lack functional price discovery mechanisms, and thus are misleading the people; therefore it was deemed necessary to support this market as a public good, in order to provide clarity to society on one of the most pressing issues.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the Russian Federation detonates a nuclear device in an offensive capacity by June 30, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nTo satisfy a \"Yes\" resolution, the detonation of a nuclear device must be in an offensive capacity (whether deliberate or accidental), must not be a test, and must be either claimed by the Russian Federation or considered by a preponderance of credible reporting and/or information from credible sources to be from the Russian Federation.\n\nFor the purpose of this market's resolution, determination as to whether a detonation was nuclear will be made by a preponderance of credible reporting.",

    "question": "zkSync airdrop by June 1?",
    "description": "This is a market on whether zkSync (https://zksync.io/) will both launch and airdrop a native token by June 1, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet, actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or \u201clive\u201d, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet, but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not \u201clive\u201d and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.\n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token\u2019s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition.\n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by June 1, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to \u201cNo\u201d.",

    "description": "This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if Joe Biden's approval rating as reported by FiveThirtyEight will be greater than or equal to 43.3% for the day of January 7, 2023. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d. \n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's approval rating poll aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/, specifically the approval rating indicated by the green trend line for the resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. \n\nThe resolution data for January 7 will be checked on January 8, 2023 (12 PM ET), and can only resolve after the check. If for any reason (e.g. error, no data taken, etc.) there is no data point for January 7 on the check time, the market will be checked 6 hours later, at 6 PM ET on January 8, 2023. If there is still no data point, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to January 7. \n\nIf Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to January 7. Please note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by March 27, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

    "description": "A 2023 election for the Mayor of Chicago resulted in no candidate getting a majority, triggering a runoff between Paul Vallas and Brandon Johnson scheduled to be held on Tuesday, April 4, 2023.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if either candidate in the 2023 Chicago mayoral runoff wins by a margin greater than 5% (e.g. margin of 5.0001% resolves to \"Yes\"). Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the margin of victory is the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by each candidate in the election. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each candidate receives by the sum of all votes received by both candidates.\n\nFor example, if Candidate A receives 53% of the votes, and Candidate B receives 47% of the votes, the difference will be found by subtracting 47 from 53, thus the margin of victory in this case would equal 6 (|Candidate A% - Candidate B%| = Margin of Victory).\n\nDetermination of the margin of victory of this election will be based on final election authority certification or other final official determination of the election results.\n\nIf this election does not take place by December 31, 2023, this market will resolve 50-50.",

    "question": "Will uninsured SVB depositors get all their money back by June 30?",
    "description": "With the closing of Silicon Valley Bank, all uninsured depositors will receive dividends as SVB\u2019s assets are liquidated, until depositors are either made whole or all assets are depleted. It is reported that SVB\u2019s assets exceed that of its deposits.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if depositors are made whole - as in this case, receive dividends that total approximately the same amount that they had deposited in SVB at time of failure, by June 30, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. If uninsured depositors are made whole via any other method (i.e. government bailout, merger or acquisition, etc.), this market will also resolve to \u201cYes.\u201d \n\nIf depositors are not made whole by June 30, 2023, the market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nThe resolution source will be the FDIC, other government-related entities direct reporting, and SVB direct reporting. A consensus of credible reporting will also suffice.",

The outcome will be corroborated by examining SpaceX\u2019s official video feed of the launch (https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceX), as well as secondary video feeds or written reports if necessary.\n\nIf the Starship completes a successful launch by March 31 2023, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d.

Any name change of the Starship or replacement of \"SN20\" with another vehicle (i.e. \"SN21\", etc.) will have no bearing on the outcome of the market.

It is scheduled for theatrical release in the USA on March 10, 2023.\n\nThis is a market on how much \u2018Scream VI' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The \u201cDomestic Weekend\u201d tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1714914049/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (Mar 10 - 12) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if \u2018Scream VI\u2019 grosses more than $45,000,000 on its opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by March 27, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

    "question": "Arbitrum airdrop by March 31st?",
    "description": "In Response to Trader Inquiry: This market still resolves to \"Yes\" if users need to pay a standard gas fee to claim the airdrop.\n\nThis is a market on whether Arbitrum (https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) will both launch and airdrop a native token by March 31, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. Launching a token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet (any Arbitrum mainnet in this case, currently Arbitrum One and/or Arbitrum Nova), actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the underlying application or protocol, and substantiated by the respective project via website or official social media channels. In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or \u201clive\u201d, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (either mainnet, in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not \u201clive\u201d and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.\n\nAirdrop in this context means that a nonzero portion of this token\u2019s supply must have been distributed for free to at least one subset of actors relevant to the underlying project, based on their retroactive, past participation in using the product or protocol, participating in the community, or some other non-transactional action that pertains to the underlying project. An airdrop is considered to have taken place if the aforementioned free token distribution occurs, regardless of lockups or restrictions on the ability to sell the airdropped token, as long as the underlying token itself is live as per the earlier definition.\n\nIf this project launches a token and performs an airdrop by March 31, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. If one or both of the objectives are not met by the resolution date, the market resolves to \u201cNo\u201d.\n",

Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by April 3, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.",

    "description": "A 2023 election for the Wisconsin Supreme Court is scheduled to be held on Tuesday, April 4, 2023, to elect a justice to the Wisconsin Supreme Court for a ten-year term. While technically a nonpartisan election, Janet Protasiewicz is backed by Democrats, and Daniel Kelly is backed by Republicans.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if either candidate in the 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court Election wins by a margin of 5.0% or greater. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of resolving this market, the margin of victory is the absolute difference between the percentages of votes received by each candidate in the election. Percentages of the votes received by each candidate will be determined by dividing the total number of votes each candidate receives by the sum of all votes received by both candidates.\n\nFor example, if Candidate A receives 53% of the votes, and Candidate B receives 47% of the votes, the difference will be found by subtracting 47 from 53, thus the margin of victory in this case would equal 6 (|Candidate A% - Candidate B%| = Margin of Victory).\n\nDetermination of the margin of victory of this election will be based on final election authority certification or other final official determination of the election results.\n\nIf this election does not take place by December 31, 2023, this market will resolve 50-50.",

It is reported that SVB\u2019s assets exceed that of its deposits.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if depositors are made whole - as in this case, receive dividends that total approximately the same amount that they had deposited in SVB at time of failure, by December 31, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. If uninsured depositors are made whole via any other method (i.e. government bailout, merger or acquisition, etc.), this market will also resolve to \u201cYes.\u201d \n\nIf depositors are not made whole by December 31, 2023, the market will resolve to \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nThe resolution source will be the FDIC, other government-related entities direct reporting, and SVB direct reporting. A consensus of credible reporting will also suffice.",
